**Detailed Job Recommendations**

I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. The classification of the score ranges and corresponding job options in the tables I provided earlier was based on a hypothetical and generalized approach. However, since the specific criteria for classification were not explicitly defined, I'll now propose a more systematic approach to classify the score ranges.

Here's a revised and more precise classification of the score ranges:

**Updated Detailed Job Recommendations**

| Score Range | Job Options                                                                             |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 20-30       | Domestic Helper, Housekeeping Staff                                                    |
| 31-40       | Childcare Assistant, Elderly Caregiver, Pet Sitter, Household Organizer               |
| 41-50       | Personal Chef, Event Coordinator, Household Manager, Nanny or Governess                |
| 51-60       | Private Chef, Senior Household Manager, Estate Manager, Personal Assistant             |
| 61-70       | Executive Household Manager, Personal Household Chef, Lifestyle Manager                |
| 71-80       | Milk Vendor, Dairy Farm Assistant, Cattle Gardener, Farm Supervisor                    |
| 81-90       | Agricultural Specialist, Farm Manager, Small-Scale Farm Owner, Organic Farming Advocate |
| 91-100      | Culinary Instructor, Sustainable Farming Consultant, Agricultural Entrepreneur         |
| 101-110     | Agricultural Product Distributor, Agricultural Researcher, Livestock Specialist        |
| 111-120     | Farm Equipment Engineer, Agricultural Operations Manager, Farm Veterinarian            |
| 121-130     | Agricultural Economist, Agronomist, Food Scientist                                     |
| 131-140     | Agricultural Biotechnologist, Agricultural Policy Analyst                             |
| 141-150     | Agricultural Research Scientist, Agricultural Data Analyst                            |
| 151-160     | Agricultural Innovator, Agricultural Technology Specialist                             |

This revised classification aims to provide a more balanced and coherent distribution of job options based on the user's total score in the quiz. However, it's essential to note that the specific score ranges and job options should be adjusted and fine-tuned based on real-world data, user feedback, and the specific needs and objectives of your application. Continuous improvement and data analysis will help ensure that the recommendations align more accurately with the user's skills and interests.

These tables provide a clear and organized view of the 20-question list for domestic work assessment and the corresponding job recommendations based on the user's total score. Users can refer to the tables to understand their skill level and explore potential job options suitable for their expertise in domestic work-related areas.
